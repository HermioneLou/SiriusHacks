# Chialisp Resource
 Chialisp is a secure language for encumbering and releasing funds with smart-contract capabilities. If you are new to Chialisp, there are some materials helping you catch up.

## Reading Materials
 All the chialisp-related documents could be found [here](https://chialisp.com/docs/).

## Videos
Chia Network provides Chialisp tutorial videos, code examples and other reference materials for developers on the [Chialisp official webiste](https://chialisp.com/docs/tutorials/why_chia_is_great).

Here we provide a brief of the tutorials.
1. The [first video](https://youtu.be/jRyTNdqP07Y) is about the smart coin model, the differences between the smart coin model and the smart contract model, the advantages of the smart coin model, and how this coin-centric approach is beneficial to the development of financial applications.

2. The [second video](https://youtu.be/lh9spX6Qv8I) gives an overview of the concepts involved in developing applications on Chia, including CLVM which runs on the Chia blockchain, the high-level language Chialisp, the basic concept of Coins, what happens when you spend a Coin, etc.

3. The [third video](https://youtu.be/y8Thrrw25rQ) explains how to set up the environment and download Chialisp-related tools. There is a package on Atom called language-chialisp, which provides syntax highlighting when users are writing Chialisp applications.

4. The [fourth video](https://youtu.be/JcC1_igwSmA) explains the Chialisp basics, including print, calling functions, using modules, looping over data, cons, building lists and recursion.

5. The [fifth video](https://chialisp.com/docs/tutorials/coin_lifecycle_and_testing) is divided into 8 parts to explain the coin lifecycle and testing. The Chialisp expert gives a walk through on how to write a simple smart coin, how to secure a smart coin, how to write driver code, how to write smart coin tests, how to deploy a smart coin to the blockchain, how to spend the coin, etc.

6. The [sixth video](https://youtu.be/kA0l9n5SEI8) explains what Singletons are and how they are involved in creating Ethereum-like contracts in Chia.

7. The last two tutorials teach you [how to lock a coin with a custom puzzle](https://chialisp.com/docs/tutorials/custom_puzzle_lock) and [how to spend a coin using RPC](https://chialisp.com/docs/tutorials/coin_spend_rpc).
