# Global Online Hackathon on Chia Network. $500K in prize pool & seed funding

**Buckle up, hup on the rocket to the top-notch hackathon at the brightest star – Sirius !**


## Introduction
Various types of hackathons have contributed a great deal to the blockchain industry so far, and various contests like hackathons have helped to incubate outstanding talent and projects for the industry; Sirius Labs and Chia, and together with leading partners, will hold a global online hackathon on Chia Network between 17th July and 30th August, 2021. We granted $500 000 to the prize pool, and winning teams will have the opportunity of receiving seed funding, please read more for details below.

Since its official launch, Chia is constantly gaining international recognition. The amount of farming equipment across the network has reached an ideal level. The number of global farmers is estimated to reach 50,000 to 100,000, which is enough to establish a large number of POC-based cloud services. With the infrastructure growing rapidly, the expansion of Chia ecosystem shall be given priority.

Chia adopts the unique consensus mechanism – PoST, Proofs of Time and Space, PoST uses verifiable delay function, which enables the internet well resistant against external attacks; By using PoST, Chia Network has lower GAS fee, faster transaction speed, more environment-friendly, is very suitable for developing decentralized applications.
 
However, Chia network is still at the early-stage of dividend period, on which relatively fewer projects exist at this moment. It is of great importance to develop the layer2 that is corresponded with lighting network, before realizing cross-chain behavior in the future, and before using chia in large-scale for more advanced developing. 

The theme of the upcoming hackathon is Create and Build, developing areas include but not limited to a better layer2, better DeFi, storage and better NFT based on Chia network.

The purpose of this hackathon is to assist teams with strong technical skills to grow, and to help chia network to become a universal eco-system from a “seed”. <br><br>

## Chia Resources
**Chia** is a modern cryptocurrency built from scratch, designed to be efficient, decentralized, and secure. Here are some of the features and benefits:<br>
- [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware<br>
- Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)<br>
- Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state<br>
- Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases<br>
- BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)<br>
- [Pooling protocol](https://www.chia.net/2020/11/10/pools-in-chia.html) (in development) that allows farmers to have control of making blocks<br>
- Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing<br>
- A growing community of farmers and developers around the world<br><br>

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki) and [FAQ](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ) for information on this project.

Python 3.7+ is required. Make sure your default python version is >=3.7 by typing python3.
If you are behind a NAT, it can be difficult for peers outside your subnet to reach you when they start up. You can enable [UPnP](https://www.homenethowto.com/ports-and-nat/upnp-automatic-port-forward/) on your router or add a NAT (for IPv4 but not IPv6) and firewall rules to allow TCP port 8444 access to your peer. These methods tend to be router make/model specific.

Most users should only install harvesters, farmers, plotter, full nodes, and wallets. Building Timelords and VDFs is for sophisticated users, in most environments. Chia Network and additional volunteers are running sufficient Timelords for consensus.

**Installing**<br>
Install instructions are available in the [INSTALL](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/INSTALL) section of the [chia-blockchain repository wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki).

**Running**<br>
Once installed, a [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) is available from the repository [wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki).<br>

## Evaluation Criteria
**ChiaLisp Based (Y/N)**  <br>
The project must be Chialisp-based. Even if  the team already launched a project in other blockchain infrastructure, they shall migrate the project to Chia Network using Chialisp.

**Category (45%)** <br>
To ensure the diversity of  Chia ecosystem, the players are required to adress certain issues, including Better Layer2, Better DeFi and Better NFT.

More attempts are also welcome, including but not limited to: decentralized computing, decentralized storage, privacy, decentralized identity, media and advertising, games, etc.

**Creativity (20%)** <br>
Creativity is core value. Investors and the community tend to capture innovative ideas and projects. Compared with existing blockchain projects or application scenarios, in what way does the project show its creativity? Does the project make full use of "Proof of Space" and "Proof of Time"? 

**Feasibility (30%)** <br>
The judges screen projects based on the white papers/technical documents uploaded to Github, and observe whether it is technically feasible? Does the project have technical or economic flaws during execution? Is the business or token model reasonable and sustainable in the long run?

**Team Execution (25%)** <br>
A combination of solid leadership, communication, and access to good resources contribute to a good team. Does the co-founder have starup experience? Do the (co-)founders have experience in the blockchain field or any other start-ups? 

**Adoption&Market (20%)** <br>
