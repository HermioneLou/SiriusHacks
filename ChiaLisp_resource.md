# Resources for New Chialisp Developers 
Chialisp language is used for building smart transactions launched by Chia network. 
If you are new to Chialisp, here are some resources to help you catch up. 


## Introduction Material 

CLVM is the compiled, minimal version of Chialisp that is used by the Chia network. To learn the basics of the language, check [CLVM basics](https://chialisp.com/docs/). 

To further learn how to create smart transactions using Chialisp, read [Coins, Spends and Wallets](https://chialisp.com/docs/coins_spends_and_wallets).

For evaluating programs, read this ["Deeper in CLVM"](https://chialisp.com/docs/deeper_into_clvm) to learn how ChiaLisp evaluates programs. 

"The High Level Language, Compiler and Functions"(https://chialisp.com/docs/high_level_lang ) introduces how to write Chialisp programs and how to compile the higher level language to lower level language so that the smart contracts could run in practice. 

As certain common functions are used in a lot of puzzles, read this [summary of Common functions in ChiaLisp](https://chialisp.com/docs/common_functions). 

If you are not sure of any terms used in the above documents, you can always check the [glossary](https://chialisp.com/docs/glossary/) to refresh your memory. <br>

If your are curious about the reasons why this old language is used as Chia's on chain programming language, read this [page](https://chialisp.com/) for details. 


## Videos 

Chia network provides a tutorial video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEFLJSU87K8&t=1768s) about the introduction to developing in chia.<br>
